#### Social Network Analysis with Gephi

With Python I've scraped information about all the people mentioned in the Dispatch. Connections between persons that were mentioned in the same article were used as the edges of the graph. Totally it came up to 33074 nodes (i.e. persons) and 183835 edges and it took about 20 hours for the graph to shape a form, which could be interpreted (I've used "Fruchterman Reingold" layout). From the graph it can be figured out, that the network is rather fragmentized. Many persons do not have connections at all (nodes that are located close to the edge of the circle). But there are also some isolated clusters with a high density of interconnections. In a real research it might be interesting to look deeper into this clusters to find out, who are these persons and what connects them.
