#### Reformatting to TSV



As our articles already have clear structure, we just need to change to change some lines in the previous code.  
1) In order to put all the issues into one file we make a new string named "dispatch" before the big loop with a line, that characterizes the new structure:
```python
dispatch = "".join("DATE \t TYPE \t HEADER \t TEXT")
```
2) Then inside the small loop we change the structure of the articles:
```python
 article = date + "\t" + "".join(typ) + "\t" + head_cleaned + "\t" + text_cleaned + "\n"
```
3) As we don't need gaps between the articles anymore, the part of the code with breaking the text after the small loop is to be removed with:
```python
dispatch = dispatch + "".join(final_list)
```
4) Finally, we move the saving lines outside of the big loop and change the name and extension of the final file:
```python
newfilename = target + "dispatch.tsv"
with open(newfilename, "w", encoding="utf8") as f9:
    f9.write(dispatch)
```
