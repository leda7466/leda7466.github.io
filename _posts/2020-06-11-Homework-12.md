#### Topic modeling

Since it has come out, that for all the Dispatch data the highest coherence score was at 6 topics (I've tried numbers from 2 till 40), IÂ´ve decided to create a model of 6 topics. Topic keywords are below:

   't00': 'enemy, gen, general, th, army, wounded, troops, river, city, '
          'yesterday',
   't01': 'th, john, county, reward, mr, richmond, court, city, negro, feet',
   't02': 'mr, states, state, general, bill, house, virginia, committee, '
          'confederate, service',
   't03': 'war, government, south, country, states, southern, union, north, '
          'lincoln, united',
   't04': 'amp, street, sale, richmond, th, office, wanted, co, house, st',
   't05': 'treasury, bonds, notes, cent, states, confederate, cotton, richmond, '
          'bank, cents'  

Obviously, such words as "th", "mr" or "amp" should have been removed as stopwords, but due to very limited capacities of my laptop I felt very reluctant to do this step, which has already taken a night, one more time. From these topics we can define such themes as "war", "justice", "politics", "war policy", "local trade" and "economy".
I've also tried to extend number of topics to 30 to see what will come out:

  't00': 'horse, district, horses, confederate, states, clerk, court, th, '
         'wagon, office',
  't01': 'reward, feet, dollars, inches, negro, richmond, black, th, delivery, '
         'paid',
  't02': 'richmond, amp, york, river, railroad, co, leave, schr, norfolk, '
         'baltimore',
  't03': 'general, officers, service, officer, orders, confederate, department, '
         'order, war, persons',
  't04': 'kentucky, missouri, louis, tennessee, morgan, louisville, nashville, '
         'st, ohio, ky',
  't05': 'amp, sale, th, street, house, hire, goods, auction, st, streets',
  't06': 'mrs, miss, mr, rev, dr, married, mary, theatre, wm, th',
  't07': 'court, mayor, yesterday, charged, case, john, stealing, arrested, '
         'slave, charge',
  't08': 'th, clock, residence, friends, died, funeral, family, attend, aged, '
         'inst',
  't09': 'city, yesterday, morning, night, mr, fire, house, train, railroad, '
         'clock',
  't10': 'treasury, bonds, notes, cent, bank, cents, states, confederate, '
         'richmond, secretary',
  't11': 'york, washington, mr, lincoln, general, union, war, president, '
         'government, states',
  't12': 'enemy, gen, army, general, th, force, cavalry, river, miles, troops',
  't13': 'mr, bill, committee, house, senate, resolution, motion, confederate, '
         'referred, military',
  't14': 'states, state, mr, convention, virginia, president, union, south, '
         'constitution, carolina',
  't15': 'church, rev, dr, city, mr, bishop, meeting, society, religious, '
         'services',
  't16': 'yankee, yankees, negroes, gold, water, white, days, worth, prisoners, '
         'use',
  't17': 'office, insurance, school, institute, richmond, st, virginia, de, '
         'gettysburg, th',
  't18': 'soldiers, richmond, city, office, army, citizens, clothing, country, '
         'sick, business',
  't19': 'states, government, th, england, british, french, london, united, '
         'cotton, american',
  't20': 'th, co, john, va, wm, capt, company, wounded, lieut, st',
  't21': 'young, life, house, hand, went, saw, heart, lady, night, around',
  't22': 'iron, work, hundred, amp, thousand, feet, water, steam, virginia, use',
  't23': 'regiment, col, battle, field, camp, company, virginia, capt, wounded, '
         'captain',
  't24': 'amp, sale, tobacco, flour, co, corn, sugar, bbls, wheat, coffee',
  't25': 'company, th, order, richmond, office, st, clock, service, street, '
         'capt',
  't26': 'page, ladies, oil, shoes, st, boots, dispatch, street, amp, th',
  't27': 'war, south, country, government, southern, north, states, power, '
         'world, northern',
  't28': 'fort, enemy, guns, fire, river, charleston, battery, island, '
         'batteries, point',
  't29': 'county, richmond, city, virginia, court, governor, counties, john, '
         'commonwealth, henrico'

With a larger number of topics we get more detailed information on such themes as cultural and religious life, death and marriages, sales of different goods and resources, military actions in different regions and so on. Nevertheless, this information is more difficult to interpret.
