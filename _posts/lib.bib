	abstract = {This paper attempts to explain why people become confused by questions about the relation between menal and physical events. When a question leads to confused, inconsistent answers, this may be (1) because the question is ultimately meaningless or at least unanswerable, but it may also be (2) because an adequate answer requires a powerful analytical apparatus. My view is that many important questions about relation between mind and brain are of this latter kind, and that some of the necessary technical and conceptual tools are becoming available as a result of work on he problems of making computer programs behave intelligently. In this paper we suggest a theory of why introspection does not give clear answers to these questions. The paper does not go very far toward finding technical solutions to the questions, but there is probably some value in finding at least a clear explanation of why we are confused.},

Kepler is striking not only for the magnitude of his discoveries but because of the articulateness with which he laid out his reasoning processes, including his frequent and extended use of analogies. I discuss four analogical subprocesses - highlighting common structure, projecting inferences, re-representing relations, and noticing alignable differences - by which analogy brings about newideas and show how they apply in Kepler’s work. I focus particularly on a central extended analogy in which he used the phenomenon of the light from the sun, which travels to the planets and illuminates them, as a base domain for a new ontological entity (a precursor of gravity) - the vis motrix, that causes the planets to move.},

	abstract = {Analogy has a rich history in Western civilization. Over the centuries, it has become reified in that analogical reasoning has sometimes been regarded as a fundamental cognitive process. In addition, it has become identified with a particular expressive format. The limitations of the modern view are illustrated by monster analogies, which show that analogy need not be regarded as something having a single form, format, or semantics. Analogy clearly does depend on the human ability to create and use well-defined or analytic formats for laying out propositions that express or imply meanings and perceptions. Beyond this dependence, research in cognitive science suggests that analogy relies on a number of genuinely fundamental cognitive capabilities, including semantic flexibility, the perception of resemblances and of distinctions, imagination, and metaphor. Extant symbolic models of analogical reasoning have various sorts of limitation, yet each model presents some important insights and plausible mechanisms. I argue that future efforts could be aimed at integration. This aim would include the incorporation of contextual information, the construction of semantic bases that are dynamic and knowledge rich, and the incorporation of multiple approaches to the problems of inference constraint.},

The first three chapters are devoted to logic, ontology, and computable models of reality. Remaining chapters apply theories to the analysis of problems stated in ordinary language, and their translation to computable form. The text is self-contained, with each new idea defined when first mentioned; all formalism is developed in the body of the text or summarized in an appendix. Knowledge Representation is appropriate for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, as well as philosophy and linguistics students with some background in artificial intelligence or programming.},

Complete agreement on their meanings among natural scientists, social scientists, philosophers of science, engineers and others seems unlikely, since meaning depends partly on context and on discipline-specific conventions. Accepted meanings of these words often depend on subject matter, and on the purposes of research. In practice, a theory, model, or explanation—or a good theory, model, or explanation—for a physicist or chemist may differ in some respects from a theory, model, or explanation for a biologist, a meteorologist, or a demographer. These differences may appear all the greater if one looks at the use of models and theories in practical decision making, as in engineering or policy formation.},
