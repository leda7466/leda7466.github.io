####Scraping the Daily Dispatch. Step-by-step instruction

1. Download the first page with the links
Command line:
*cd C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\DH\wget-1.20.3-win64*
*wget ``http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus:collection:RichTimes``*

2. Search through the downloaded file with regular expressions to find the links. A command that definitely works: *text\?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a....\...\.....*

3. Select all the links and paste them into a new file

4. Add *``http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/dl``* at the beginning of every link with the *replace* function

5. Save the document as links.txt

6. Download all the materials in the new folder named *newspapers*
Command line:
*wget -i links.txt -P ./newspapers/*

7.	And wait **a little bit**â€¦

Done!
